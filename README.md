# Predicting-Heart-Disease
## Predicting Heart Disease using ML/K-NN

In this project we will be analyzing a dataset from a R&D company which provides cardiovascular information about patients. The data has been collected from multiple hospitals and anonymized for use, the dataset contains features such as Age, Sex, RestingECG, ST_slope and HeartDisease. Using some Machine lerning models we will aim to predict whether or not a new patient will have heart disease. This revelvant because many people suffer from heart disease because of a variety of factors.
